# ðŸ—ƒ BIOS Files

Some emulator cores within Ignited require BIOS files in order to function, which are files that contain data found on a real system's hardware. The emulator cores within Ignited use these BIOS files to emulate things like startup screens and the DS Home Screen, as well as to more accurately emulate games.

_**\*BIOS files are not supplied by Ignited, and I cannot help you find them.**_
