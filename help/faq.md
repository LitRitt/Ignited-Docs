## <mark style="color:orange;">Q: Can I transfer my games and saves from Delta?</mark>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Q: Where can I get games/ROMs/BIOS files?</mark>

A: I can't help you find these files. A simple google search should point you in the right direction.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Q: Will you add (retro system) to the app?</mark>

A: Probably not. I'm not very interested in any new systems beside eventually 3DS. Also I currently lack the technical coding skills to implement new cores into the app. That being said, I will gladly add new systems to the app if other devs put in the effort to add new cores.
