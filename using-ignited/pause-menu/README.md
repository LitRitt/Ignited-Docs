# ⏸ Pause Menu

The pause menu gives you quick access to several of Ignited's features. It is accessible by pressing the '•••' menu button on the default controller skins, or the appropriate input on a connected controller. When the pause menu is opened by a controller, it cannot be closed by another controller, and all hold button mappings are recieved for the pausing controller.
