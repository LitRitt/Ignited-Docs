# 🕹 Games

Games for Ignited are found in the form of ROMs, which are files that contain all the data found on a real game cartridge. The emulator cores within Ignited use these ROMs to play games. ROMs are not supplied by Ignited, and I cannot help you [find](https://vimm.net/vault) them.

## <mark style="color:orange;">How to Import Games</mark>

You can add games to your library by tapping '+' beside the settings gear icon in the top left and choosing to import from either Files or iTunes.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Files Import</mark>

The Files option allows you to import games using the built in Files app. You can select multiple games at once. Files can remain compressed `.zip` files or can be uncompressed in one of the [supported file formats](games.md#supported-file-formats).

### <mark style="color:yellow;">iTunes Import</mark>

The iTunes option allows you to import games added via iTunes or Finder. Game files can also be manually placed in the `On My Device -> Ignited` folder and they will be imported with this option as well.
