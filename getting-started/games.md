# ðŸ•¹ Games

Games for Ignited are found in the form of ROMs, which are files that contain all the data found on a real game cartridge. The emulator cores within Ignited use these ROM files to play games.

\***ROM files are not supplied by Ignited, and I cannot help you find them**[**!**](https://vimm.net/vault)

## How to Import Games

You can add games to your library by tapping '+' beside the settings gear icon in the top left and choosing to import from either Files or iTunes.

### Files Import

The Files option allows you to import games using the built in Files app. You can select multiple games at once. Files can remain compressed `.zip` files or can be uncompressed in one of the [supported file formats](games.md#supported-file-formats).

### iTunes Import

The iTunes option allows you to import games added via iTunes or Finder. Game files can also be manually placed in the `On My Device -> Ignited` folder and they will be imported with this option as well.
