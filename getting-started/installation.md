# ðŸ“² Installation

This page will show you the supported methods of installing Ignited onto your device. The easiest method by far is over-the-air (OTA) installation, which is offered as a benefit to my Patreon patrons and Discord subscribers. Installation is always a button press away, and the app stays signed while you're a supporter. AltStore is a completely free method, but requires a computer and resigning the app must be done every week to continue using the app.

## OTA Method

1. Become a patron on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/litritt) OR become a subscriber on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qEtKFJt5dR)
2. Submit your device UDID following the instructions in the welcome message
3. Wait patiently for 1-3 days until Apple finishes registering your device
4. Use [this link](https://itms-services/?action=download-manifest\&url=https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/lit-apps/ignited/1.6.1/manifest.plist) to install Ignited

## AltStore Method

1. Download [AltServer](https://altstore.io) for Mac or PC
2. Connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer via Lightning or USB-C cable
3. Follow [these instructions](https://faq.altstore.io/) for installing AltStore
4. Use [this link](altstore://install?url=https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/lit-apps/ignited/1.6.1/Ignited.ipa) to install Ignited
