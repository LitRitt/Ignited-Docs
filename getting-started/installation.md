# ðŸ“² Installation

The easiest method is over-the-air (OTA) installation, which is offered as a benefit to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/litritt) patrons. Installation is always a button press away, and the app stays signed while you're a supporter. AltStore is a completely free method, but requires a computer and resigning the app must be done every week to continue using the app.
