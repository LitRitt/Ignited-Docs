# ðŸ“² Installation

The easiest method is over-the-air (OTA) installation, which is offered as a benefit to OTA and Premium members of my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/litritt). Installation is always a button press away, and the app stays signed while you're a supporter. This method is great for sharing Ignited with friends and family, since any device can be added by obtaining its UDID.

Patrons in the Beta tier and higher also have access to Ignited through Apple's TestFlight beta testing platform. This method is simple, convenient, and lets you install the app on any device connected to your Apple ID. TestFlight also receives early access to new features and changes while they are being developed.

AltStore is a completely free method, but requires a computer and resigning the app must be done every week to continue using the app.
